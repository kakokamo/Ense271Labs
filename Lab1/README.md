**General Thought Process od Developing Story Map:**
I wanted to make this grocery app similar to InstaCart and SkipTheDishes by providing basic goals of what a user does to get to the submission of their order:
    1. Open and use the app
    2. Select the groceries
    3. Buy the groceries

After that, I thought about adding the steps on how to achieve those goals, which in short were:
    1. Create and Log into your account after opening up the app
    2. Acknowledge items and select the ones to you want to add to the cart
    3. Provide payment and location details to complete the order and allow store to get the groceries and give them to courier to take it to you

Then I thought about providing more details in the Tasks part, by using real life references, so the story map could be easily understood by other people who are viewing my story map.

**Three decisions made by me when creating the stories in map:**
1. Make the stories longer than it should be of when a user buys groceries online.
  -> I did this because there is a lot of processes when it comes to getting groceries online, especially when it comes to provinding your location details and provinding your payment methods. If a person was to make a grocery app, they need to follow these steps in order to protect users personal data and securely drop their groceries off at the right location, while also provinding quality user experience on the app.
  -> The results can be seen with how many tasks I have in my story map

2. Provide real life references.
  -> I used real examples of grocery and food ordering apps such as InstaCart and SkipTheDishes to see what they have in their apps, so that I could easily make the necessary tasks in order to complete the story map
  -> The results of this decision is captured in the tasks section of the stor map, as I have provided details in how the user can make an account, choose a form of payment method, and choose their location as a user would in InstaCart and SkipTheDishes.

3. Look at other people's story maps
  -> I did this to get an idea on how to structure my story map and to further understand the lab requirements
  -> On the dashboard of my StoriesOnBoard account, it shows all the people's story maps i've seen, I'm not sure if you want me to provide a screenshot of my dashboard, but I will provide one anyways.

**Extra Features that I Tried on the second release task:**
 -> Adding a Persona
 -> Changing Colour of the task to red
